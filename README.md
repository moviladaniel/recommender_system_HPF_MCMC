# Movie Recommender System using Collaborative-Filtering Methods (Hierarchical Poisson Factorization and Markov Chain Monte Carlo).

This project develops a movie recommender system using Hierarchical Poisson Factorization (HPF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, implemented in PyMC. The dataset includes user ratings, movie details, and user demographics, meticulously preprocessed for modeling. The HPF model, utilizing Gamma distributions for user and item latent factors, is rigorously trained, evaluated, and tuned. Despite the scalability challenges of MCMC compared to Variational Inference, the system demonstrates promising results in personalized movie recommendations, showcasing the potential of Bayesian methods in collaborative filtering.

The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ranitsarkar01/movies-recommender-system-dataset/data under the (DbCL) v1.0 license.
